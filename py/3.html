      You decide to attack the Romans. This was not a smart decision. Though they had their weapons in hand, it was only as precaution (as you are in a giant flying battleship). Your sign of offence has caused a frenzy in the camp. Since they are Romans, they have a natural instinct to defend themselves and their honor. By being the first attackers, you have initiated the battle and greatly disrespected them. Also, Annabeth, who has been looking for her boyfriend for the past year, wanted you to land. As you have completely went against her, you have been made her angry. 
As you are only a group of 4, you are bound to lose the battle. What do you do?
        <input type="radio" name="option" value="4">Fly away in your ship.
        <input type="radio" name="option" value="9">Continue to attack them because they are on the ground and cannot use melee weapons against you.
