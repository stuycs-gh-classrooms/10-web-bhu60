      You have decided to change to Annabeth. The leader of Camp Jupiter Reyna has requested a special meeting with you because you both are essentially the female leaders of both camps. She greets you happily and takes you to her favorite spot of the camp, her mother’s temple. As you explain your story and she shares her own, you spot an explosion in the distance. The sound of cannonballs can be heard echoing near your ship. As she asks “why did you attack”, you say that you do not know why they are attacking. She senses that you are telling the truth. You and her go running down to the ship to see Leo attacking the Romans. What do you do?
        <input type="radio" name="option" value="7">Try to plead with the Romans for peace.
        <input type="radio" name="option" value="8">Just take the people that are in the Prophecy of 7 and leave.
