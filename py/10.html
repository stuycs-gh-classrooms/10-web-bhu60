      You have continued to be Jason and decided to meet with the Roman demigods. After your abrupt disappearance from the camp over a year ago, you explain that the Queen of the Gods switched you and Percy (the leader of the Greek camp) between the two camps. You explain that this was supposed to unite the two camps by having their leaders switched. The Romans also update you on the current situation in the Roman camp. They say that Percy, along with Reyna, has been made leaders. Also, they have firsthand experience with Gaea and her giants (the enemies you are hoping to extinguish): they fought them just yesterday and won. Now that you are back at your old camp, what do you do?
