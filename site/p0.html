    <h1>The Main Parts of the Treaty of Versailles Included:</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>1. Lost land in the creation of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the loss of all oversea colonies</li>
        <li>2. Demilitarizing of the Rhineland</li>
        <li>3. Limiting the army to 100,000 people and not having a naval or air force</li>
        <li>4. Article 231: War Guilt Clause</li>
        <li>5. No Anschluss (unification of Germany and Austria)</li>
        <li>6. Reparations (needing to pay money)</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>1. Lost Land:</h2>
      <p>Through the creation of other countries by the Allies, many Germans were divided into countries that used to be their own. This created unsettlement because people want to be part of country with their own ethnic people.</p>
    <h2>2. Demilitarization of the Rhineland</h2>
      <p>The Rhineland is the area between Germany and France. As most of the war on the West occured in France, they wanted a buffer zone that would hopefully prevent Germany from invading again. Along with having no military presence, the Allies would occupy troops for 11 years.</p>
    <h2>3. Limiting the army and no naval/air force</h2>
