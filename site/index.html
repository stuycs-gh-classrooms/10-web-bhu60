      <p>As I have great interest about World War II, this aims to pin the causes of the war both in Europe and America. The first section is a long-term cause: the Treaty of Versailles and the result of World War 1. Here, I point the basic premises of the treaty (including losing severe amounts of land, the demilitarization of the Rhineland, the decreased size of the army, the War Guilt Clause, and banning unification between Germany and Austria). While some parts of the treaty were fair, such as limiting the army and losing land, the War Guilt Clause being unfair inflamed the German population. As Germany wasn't the actual one to start the war, they were forced to accept full blame for it. The next is also a long-term cause: the Rise of Dictators and the European policy of Appeasement. The Rise of Dictators explains how and why they came to power in Germany and Italy (as they were the main Axis powers in Europe). Appeasement is simply France and Britain letting Germany doing whatever they want, until they don't with Poland. Finally, we have the immediate cause of the US joining the war: the attack on Pearl Harbor. I answer why Japan would attack neutral country and what it aimed to get out of it.</p>
