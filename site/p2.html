    <h1>What is appeasement?</h1>
      <p>Appeasement is a practice employed by the French and British. It essentially was saying to let Germany and Hitler take whatever lands he wanted, even if it broke the Treaty of Versailles. Also, Hitler broke parts 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the treaty, making it essentially ineffective. While in the present day lens we can criticize the UK and France, we have to be reminded that the British and French citizens really did not want another war and would have done anything to prevent one.</p>
    <h2>What about when the war actually started?</h2>
      <p>Even as both the France and UK declared war on Germany, for about 8 months, they did absolutely nothing. This was an appeasementesque policy as the only thing they did was prepare for war. It was known as the Phoney War. Now what ended this war you may ask. Well, it was not even the Allied powers but Germamy that ended it with the invasion of France. Their period of indicision came to bite them back as France fell in only a month and a half. This victorious power who had fended off Germany in the last war was brutally defeated (with having similar amounts of troops: 3 million). In fact, a whole million were taken within the span of a week, leading to the Paris and France falling. </p>
