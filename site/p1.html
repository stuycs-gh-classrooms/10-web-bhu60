    <h1>Germany and Italy</h1>
    <p>The first thing you might ask is why? Why would any citizen agree to and even echo the words of evil dictators? Let's put ourselves into the perspectives of them: they have just come out of a war where many of their family members have died and they are now living in poverty. They struggle for basic supplies and are now in debt for the reparations. Now, when some figure is coming and saying that they will come take you out of this depression (which was impacting the victorious pwoers, except the US who became the largest economy selling weapons), they don't really have much to lose. </p>
    <br>
    <p>An important point to make is that not everybody agreed with what they were saying, they just wanted a change for the better. However, for those that it did resonate with them, they were motivated by natinality. As both Mussolini and Hitler wanted to restore their country into the Roman Empire for Italy and a Germanic one for Germany, they wanted to unite netionalities together.</p>
